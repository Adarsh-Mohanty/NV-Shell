# NV-Shell
A command line shell with nice techy UI. It is written in php. By default the password is "secret" so the shell is accessed by adding a "pass" parameter to the url like this http://example.com/shell.php?pass=secret . The password can easily be changed by just changing it in the initial if clause.(properly mentioned where to change in file)
